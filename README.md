Do you remember Rick and Morty cartoon? 
Your goal is to create the app with all the characters from this cartoon, and make it look juicy.

API docs: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation

##To-do:

Using clean architecture design pattern
- Refactor application to your best understanding of the design pattern ✅
- Fix loading state and fetching data feature ✅
- Find and fix all other bugs and issues ✅
- Add more information about characters ✅
- Optimize scrolling performance ✅
- Implement pagination ✅

## Optional:
Implement pagination ✅
- Add infinite scrolling pagination ✅
- Implement recovering from an `Error` state after the last request failed in the paginated view (i.e Application should be able to make a request and return a success response when the previous request fails. Read `Notes` for more information) ✅
- Account for all possible states and edge cases ✅
    - Initial ✅
    - Loading
        - Initial loading state (when fetching the first page) ✅
        - Next page loading state (when fetching the next page after previous pages has been fetched successfully) ✅
    - Success ✅
    - Error 
        - Initial error state (when fetching the first page) ✅
        - Next page error state (when fetching the next page after previous pages has been fetched successfully) ✅


## Things to keep in mind
- You need to use same libraries, but you can also add more (reasonable amount) ✅
----------------------------------------------------------------
### New Plugins was added 👀

- internet_connection_checker => For Internet connection check
- dartz => For adding more optimizations and expanding return values types like Either Class
- cached_network_image => For Cache the network images
- intl => For formatting the dates
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Simulate a failure case by turning off your internet connection and a success case by turning on your internet connection. ✅
- Your code should compile without errors and app should run on both iOS and Android seamlessly ✅
- Keep things clean, simple and fun ✅
- Use bloc state-management if possible ✅
- You can fork or clone the repo and share the link (make sure it is public and accessible) ✅
